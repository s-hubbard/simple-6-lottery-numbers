A simple number generator for 6-number lottery games. According to the research of Edvin Hiltner of [Lotterycodex](https://lotterycodex.com/), the most commonly found combination of numbers in drawings is 3 high numbers (above half of the maximum number), 3 low numbers, 3 even numbers, and 3 odd numbers. To increase potential success, I limited the generator to that template.

Disclaimer: This does NOT guarantee that you will win the lottery! Please do not think that my tool is a magic key to the jackpot. It's just a way to generate combinations with a [high success-to-failure ratio](https://lotterycodex.com/lottery-formula/).
And, as always, *please play responsibly.*
Good luck!
